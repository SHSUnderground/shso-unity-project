# SHSO Remake Unity Project
This is the Unity project for the SHSO remake, you can use it to connect to your own self-hosted instance but not the public server for security reasons.
You will also need to copy the AssetBundles folder from Assets into the output **_data** folder, and edit the `server.xml` file located in `AssetBundles/Configuration` to point at your self-hosted server (`127.0.0.1` should do the trick, unless you are hosting the server in a VM, I think).  
For the server files, go to [SHSUnderground/shso-server](https://github.com/SHSUnderground/shso-server).
